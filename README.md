# Rebex
A more user friendly version of regular expressions, implemented in Ruby.

# Current State
The expressions themselves and the stability is at version 0.9.
But integration and code structure are still at the 0.1 level (should change soon).
The 1.0 should be a Ruby function converting rebex into Regex.
The 2.0 version should be a string find/replace/parse toolkit for Ruby.

# Notes
This is a feature inside of the Resh repo, but it had enough merit also have its own repo.
